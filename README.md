# vimconf

This is my personal configuration, compiled from various sources (with things added, depending on the system I'm on). Please see [The Ultimate vim Configuration](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) for the bulk of the good good.

## Installation

Move the files with the `dot.vim` prefix to `~/.vim` (basically, your home directory less `dot.`). Customize further.

## Removal

```bash
rm -rf ~/.vim*
```

_don't do that specifically -- I'm not liable for you nuking your custom settings because you ran some random command from the interwebs. Delete responsibly._

## Licensing

Do whatever you want with it. Credit to those that came before -- most of this stuff is stuff I've found elsewhere and take absolutely no responsibility for. YMMV.
